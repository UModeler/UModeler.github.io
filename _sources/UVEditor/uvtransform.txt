Transform
*************
 | There are 4 types of elements you can select and transform.
 |
 |  • UV - A point. Two edges meets at one UV.
 |  • Edge - Two connected UVs.
 |  • Polygon - A flat closed shape which consists of n-UVs and n-edges
 |  • Island - A set of polygons
 |
 | A way of selecting them is to click on each element or drag a mouse holding ``LMB`` to include elements in a rectangle. Holding ``CTRL`` enables you to select elements successively without canceling former selection.
 |
 | The element type is determined by what tool among UV, Edge, Polygon and Island on the inspector is chosen.

 | Once several elements are selected, they can be transformed using 4 sorts of gizmos.
 | Each gizmo can be switched by clicking on a corresponding button on the top toolbar or pressing ``W``, ``E``, ``R`` or ``T`` like you do in Unity.
 | If you drag an element, the element will follow the mouse cursor.

     Selecting and transfoming UVs
 
 | The default pivot position for rotating and scaling is the center of the selected elements. If you want to change the pivot location, use `Cross Cursor`, which can be enabled in `Settings` on the inspector. The location of the `Cross Cursor` will be the pivot when you transform elements while it is visible on the working area.
