Steps
--------------------
1. Select ``Material Tool``.
2. Select polygons where you want to assign a material if no polygon is selected.
3. If ``Materials`` doesnâ€™t have a material you want, add a new material slot by clicking ``Add Slot`` button at the end of the properties to open the material box and select one. 
4. Press ``Alt + n`` shorcut or Click on ``Alt + n`` or ``A`` button in the slot. It'll assign the material in the slot to the selected polygons.
5. Click ``LMB`` holding ``SHIFT`` over a polygon to which you want to assign the current material.

.. tip::

 ``Alt + 0`` ~ ``Alt + 9`` shortcuts work in other tools as well so you don't need to enter Material tool if you use ``Alt + n`` shortcuts to assign a material.
