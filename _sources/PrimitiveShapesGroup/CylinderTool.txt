5. Type the count of edges in ``Segment`` field, radius in ``Radius`` field and height in ``Height`` field if necessary.
6. Press ``SPACE`` to complete or Press ``ESC`` to cancel.

Interface

``SPACE``
 Completes creating a cylinder
 
``ESC``

Angle Snap
 When you drag the mouse with this property on, the diskâ€™s direction will snap to every 90 degree.

Border Check
 If this is enabled, the ray cast will run and it checks if the created cylinder is beyond the other polygons. It might cause a stop for a second at the beginning.
 
Glue
 The cylinder with this property enabled will be glued to the polygon where it started to be created. It means that the hidden part of the floor polygon by the created cylinder is removed.
