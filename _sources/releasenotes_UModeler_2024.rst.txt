Version 2.10.17 | Jan. 17, 2024
=================================
- Resolved a visibility issue with meshes in the built version, ensuring they remain invisible in Playmode as intended.
- Addressed a problem causing custom settings for Move Snap Size and Rotation Snap Size to vanish upon reloading the project, ensuring persistence of these settings.
- Corrected a behavior where the Dirty flag was erroneously activated when transitioning from Play mode to Edit mode.
