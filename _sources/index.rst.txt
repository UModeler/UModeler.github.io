Introduction
============

​UModeler is a modeling tool in Unity which makes it easier to create various geometric models from prototype levels to complex static meshes, without the external DCC tools.​
Those geometric figures made with UModeler can also be used for collision, navigation mesh, trigger zone etc.​
This will help you a lot in creating great game worlds.
