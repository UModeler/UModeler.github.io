Stair

We'll make a stair on the front wall.

 1.Using Polyline tool, draw an edge across the front wall from top and bottom at the center.

 2.Using Parallel tool, draw two edges at the either side from the center edge at a distance of 1m

 3.Go to Polyline tool. draw an edge across the three edges drawn in step 1 and 2 starting at a point of the veranda as below.

 4.Using Parallel tool, make two parall edges at a distance of 0.5m above from the two horizontal edges.

 5.Go to Erase tool leaving no vertex/edge/polygon selected. Remove unnecessary edges to leave a rectangle as follows.

 6.Using Extrude tool, pull the left rectangle in step 5 by 3m

 7.Go to Parallel tool. Make two edges 0.08m apart from either side edge on the protuding front face.

 8.As you did in step 7, make edges 0.08m apart from either side edge on the protuding top face.
 Instead of using Parallel tool, you can use apolyline tool to draw edges connecting the end point of the edges drawn in step 7 to the point on the wall.

 9.Using Parallel tool, make 7 edges starting from the bottom edge of the protuding front face at intervals of 0.2m. With SHIFT+LMB, you can make them quickly.

 10.Go to Extrude tool to push the rest top rectangle of the protuding front face up to the wall.
 "Boundary Check" property in the inspector needs to be on while doing this.

 11.Push the next rectangle by 1.8m with Extrude tool.

 12.Using Extrude tool push the next rectangles in order by -1.5, -1.2, -0.9, -0.6, -0.3m respectively.

 13.Using Eraser tool, remove the edge on the wall as below.

 14.Go to Polyline tool. Draw an edge connecting the center of the top segment to the center of the side segment of a side handrail face as follows.

 15.Using Extrude tool leaving "Boundary Check" enabled push the triangle face made in step 14 till it disappears.

 16.Repeat what you did in step 14 and 15 in order to make the other handrail inclined.
