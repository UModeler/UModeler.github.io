1. Using Parallel tool, draw a paraell edge with the bottom edge of one of the roof at a distance of 1.3m

2. Make another parallel edge with the edge drawn in step 1 at a distance of 2.0m

3. Draw an edge across the roof from the top center to the bottom center as below.

4. Go to Parallel tool to make two edges at either side from the center edge at a distance of 1m as follow.

5. Remove all edges apart from edges consisting of the rectangle below using Eraser tool.

6. Using Edge tool, select the upper edge of the rectangle left in step 5

7. Go to Extrude tool. At this point the current tool will become "Extrude Edge" tool because one edge is selected.
Move the gizmo in the X direction so that a rectangle created by this movement will cover the lower rectangle.

8. If the rectangle created in step 7 sees down, click "Flip" button in the inspector to flip the rectangle.

9. Go to Edge tool in order to select the bottom edge on the rectangle left in step 5. And then go to Extrude tool to move the selected edge up to the rectange made in step 7 and 8.
"Snap To Polygon" in the inspector should be enabled while doing this. This makes the edge snap to a close polygon.

14. Choose Extrude Tool to make the current tool Extrude Edge Tool. 
Drag the translation gizmo to stretch the selected edge toward the building.

15. Using Extrude Edge Tool, pull down an edge of the top retangle to the bottom rectangle made in step 14. 
Make sure that "Snap To Polygon" property in the inspector is enable while doing this.

19. Click Bridge Tool to fill the space between the two selected edges with a polygon.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_18.jpg
  
20. Fill the opposite hole as you did in steps 18 and 19.

21. Using Polyline tool, draw an edge splitting the top rectangle in half as below.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_20.jpg
  
22. Go to Edge tool to select the edge drawn in Step 21 and move it up by 0.5m

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_21.jpg
  
23. Using Extrude Tool, pull up either inclined sides of the roof by 0.06m. "Leave Side Edges" property needs to be on.

24. Get rid of the two polygons, which look sunken, at the top of the roof with Eraser Tool.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_23.jpg

25. Go to Edge tool and select two top edges of the roof as below.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_24.jpg
  
26. Select two edge consisting of the triangle hole at the front as follows.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_25.jpg

27. Select Bridge Tool to fill the triangle hole with a polygon.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_26.jpg
  
28. Fill the opposite triangle hole as you did in steps 26 and 27.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_27.jpg
  
29. Go to Eraser Tool to get rid of the edges left in steps 25,26,27 and 28.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_28.jpg
  
30. Draw an edge dividing the top rectangle in half with Polyline Tool as below.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_29.jpg
  
31. Move up the edge drawn in step 30 properly by dragging the translation gizmo as shown below.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_30.jpg
  
32. Using Polygon Tool, select a polygon at the top of the roof.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_31.jpg
  
33. Holding CTRL, select the other polygon below the selected polygon in step 32.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_32.jpg
  
34. Go to Flatten Tool to flatten the two selected polygons.
