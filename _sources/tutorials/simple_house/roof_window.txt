2. Make another parallel edge with the edge drawn in step 1 at a distance of 2.0m

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_1.jpg

3. Draw an edge across the roof from the top center to the bottom center as below.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_2.jpg

4. Go to Parallel tool to make two edges at either side from the center edge at a distance of 1m as follow.

5. Remove all edges apart from edges consisting of the rectangle below using Eraser tool.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_4.jpg

6. Using Edge tool, select the upper edge of the rectangle left in step 5

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_5.jpg

7. Go to Extrude tool. At this point the current tool will become "Extrude Edge" tool because one edge is selected.
Move the gizmo in the X direction so that a rectangle created by this movement will cover the lower rectangle.

8. If the rectangle created in step 7 sees down, click "Flip" button in the inspector to flip the rectangle.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_7.jpg

9. Go to Edge tool in order to select the bottom edge on the rectangle left in step 5. And then go to Extrude tool to move the selected edge up to the rectange made in step 7 and 8.
"Snap To Polygon" in the inspector should be enabled while doing this. This makes the edge snap to a close polygon.

13. Using Edge Tool, choose an edge as below.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_12.jpg

14. Choose Extrude Tool to make the current tool Extrude Edge Tool.
Drag the translation gizmo to stretch the selected edge toward the building.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_13.jpg

15. Using Extrude Edge Tool, pull down an edge of the top retangle to the bottom rectangle made in step 14.
Make sure that "Snap To Polygon" property in the inspector is enable while doing this.

16. Using Polygon Tool, select the outside polygon cut in step 15 as follows.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_15.jpg

17. Get rid of the selected polygon with Eraser Tool.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_16.jpg

18. Go to Edge Tool. Choose the two edges at a side hole as below.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_17.jpg

19. Click Bridge Tool to fill the space between the two selected edges with a polygon.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_18.jpg

20. Fill the opposite hole as you did in steps 18 and 19.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_19.jpg

21. Using Polyline tool, draw an edge splitting the top rectangle in half as below.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_20.jpg

22. Go to Edge tool to select the edge drawn in Step 21 and move it up by 0.5m

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_21.jpg

23. Using Extrude Tool, pull up either inclined sides of the roof by 0.06m. "Leave Side Edges" property needs to be on.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_22.jpg

24. Get rid of the two polygons, which look sunken, at the top of the roof with Eraser Tool.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_23.jpg

25. Go to Edge tool and select two top edges of the roof as below.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_24.jpg

26. Select two edge consisting of the triangle hole at the front as follows.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_25.jpg

27. Select Bridge Tool to fill the triangle hole with a polygon.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_26.jpg

28. Fill the opposite triangle hole as you did in steps 26 and 27.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_27.jpg

29. Go to Eraser Tool to get rid of the edges left in steps 25,26,27 and 28.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_28.jpg

30. Draw an edge dividing the top rectangle in half with Polyline Tool as below.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_29.jpg

31. Move up the edge drawn in step 30 properly by dragging the translation gizmo as shown below.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_30.jpg

32. Using Polygon Tool, select a polygon at the top of the roof.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_31.jpg

33. Holding CTRL, select the other polygon below the selected polygon in step 32.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_32.jpg

34. Go to Flatten Tool to flatten the two selected polygons.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_33.jpg

35. Flatten the opposite roof side likewise

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_34.jpg

36. Using Eraser tool, remove two edges at the top of the roof as below.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_35.jpg

37. Pull the front face of the roof by 0.15m with Extrude tool leaving "Leave Side Edges" off

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_36.jpg

38. Pull the either sides of the roof by 0.2m with Extrude tool leaving "Leave Side Edges" off

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_37.jpg

39. Using Inset Tool, make a polygon at the front which is 0.06m smaller than the front face.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_38.jpg

40. Push the front smaller face created in step 39 by 0.1m with Extrude Tool.

  .. figure:: /images/tutorials/simple_house/roofwindow_39.jpg

41. Using Eraser Tool, remove all the edges on the roof of the main house drawn in steps 1~5.
