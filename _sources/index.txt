Introduction
============

​UModeler is a modeling tool on Unity3D which makes it easier to create various geometric models from prototype levels to complex static meshes in Unity3D.​
Those geometric figures made with UModeler can also be used for rendering, collision, navigation mesh, trigger zone etc.​
This will help you a lot in creating great game worlds.  

Key Features
============

  Any polygons can be drawn easily and you can turn them into 3D shapes in intuitive ways.
